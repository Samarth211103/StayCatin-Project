# StayCatin-Project
Analyzed the StayCatin property dataset and created 10+ interactive visual insights, including earnings comparison, pricing analysis, review density, and geographic distribution of hosts.  Identified top-earning hosts (e.g., Ed: $526K, Rebecca: $470K) and high-price properties (up to $94,835) using bar charts, scatter plots, and geo-maps.
