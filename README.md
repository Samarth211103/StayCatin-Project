# 📊 StayCatin Dataset – Data Story & Visualization Project

This project analyzes the **StayCatin property dataset** using data visualization techniques to uncover insights related to host earnings, pricing patterns, customer reviews, and geographic distribution of listings.
The analysis is presented through multiple **clean, structured, insight-driven dashboards**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Using the StayCatin dataset, I created a set of visual stories that answer key business questions such as:

* Who are the **top-earning hosts**?
* Which properties generate the **highest pricing or earnings**?
* How do **reviews correlate with pricing**?
* What locations produce the **highest revenue**?
* Which hosts dominate in terms of **bookings and customer engagement**?

All visualizations are extracted from the PDF analysis provided .
